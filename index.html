        <h2>Junior Web Developer</h2>
        <h3>Still Media Group LLC.</h3>
        <p>As a Junior Web Developer at Still Media Group, a photography-focused company specializing in capturing
            significant life events, I played a pivotal role in enhancing the company's online presence. My
            responsibilities
            encompassed leveraging foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript to craft visually stunning and
            user-friendly web pages. Collaborating closely with the creative team, I contributed to showcasing our
            photography services in a captivating digital format. While my JavaScript skills were in their infancy, I
            utilized them to introduce subtle interactivity, enriching the overall user experience on our website. This
            experience not only strengthened my HTML and CSS abilities but also provided me with a foundational
            understanding of web development within a real-world context.</p>
        <h2>Junior Front-End Developer</h2>
        <h3>The Vault Virtual Reality</h3>
        <p>In my previous role as a Junior Front-End Developer at The Vault VR, I spearheaded tasks crucial to creating
            immersive user experiences in virtual reality. From programming interactive elements for hand tracking,
            motion controllers, and VR peripherals to optimizing applications for peak performance, I ensured a seamless
            and engaging VR environment. The emphasis on compatibility led me to develop applications that seamlessly
            operated across diverse VR platforms and devices, ensuring consistent experiences. Addressing VR-specific
            challenges, I identified and resolved bugs tied to user interactions, guaranteeing a polished end-user
            experience. Conducting user testing sessions allowed me to refine UI/UX designs based on user preferences
            and behaviors within VR applications. These experiences refined my skills in developing high-performance,
            user-friendly VR applications that cater to diverse hardware setups and user needs.</p>
